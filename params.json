  "body": "### Description\r\nOnce again you can easily transport hundreds of tons of cargo, dozens of Kerbals or rovers to distant shores.  Go yachting on Eve's Explodium Sea, support multiple bases on Laythe by water or experience history and take a Paddle-wheel cruise up Kerbin's rivers.  Looking for the ultimate pilot challenge? Try landing on the CVE. \r\n\r\nThe ocean is your frontier and to conquer it you only need imagination... and the Maritime Pack 2.0.\r\n\r\n### To Do List.\r\n1.  Add a buoyancy control system\r\n2.  Update Pleasure Craft\r\n3.  Update CVE\r\n4.  Update Roll on Roll of\r\n5.  Update Sub\r\n6.  Add Tweakscale hulls\r\n7.  Make all parts compatible with Sinking About\r\n8.  Implement arrestor system for the CVE\r\n9.  Texturing Switching (Military grey, white, stock-alike, industrial) (Will need someone who can do texturing for this)\r\n10. Make a separate Armour mod\r\n11. Make a Military preset (Armour, higher crash tolerance, weighs more)\r\n12. Add KIS compatibility\r\n13. Add a new shipping container part\r\n14. Make a Commercial preset (Weighs less, more internal space for fuel and/or KIS parts)\r\n15. Add the ability to repair armour (Will produce a lot of heat and is very slow)\r\n\r\n### The Team (So far...)\r\n\r\nMyself, Ben from BT Industries (.CFG Hacker and Project Coordinator)\r\n\r\nAnd a big thanks to the following members of the team because without the help from these people Maritime Pack 2.0 would not be possible.\r\n\r\nT from BT Industries (Tester)\r\n\r\nSumimoto (Boats and Sea Navigation Expert)\r\n\r\nG.man (Modeler)\r\n\r\nCliftonM (Plugin Developer)\r\n\r\nadsii1970 (Banner and Media Artist)\r\n\r\n### Available Jobs\r\nThis a list of jobs that we currently have missing in the current team.\r\n\r\nNobody is obliged to take up these roles it is all up too you.\r\n\r\nTexturer'er\r\n3D Modeler (Yes we already have one but two is better than one, right?)\r\nIf you would like to help in anyway listed on this list (or not) send me a PM. \r\n\r\nIf you don't really want to be part of the team full time but you have something you would like to share/donated to the mod (A new part, Some textures or maybe just help balance the parts) you are free to request a pull on our GitHub page and I'll check the changes and except it if I like what I see.
